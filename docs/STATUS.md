notes: v4l2-ctl is absent, so recon used read-only sysfs/direct V4L2 ioctls. Pan and tilt absolute controls are exposed on /dev/video0. Jetson wall clock is unset (1970); verified_at uses the Mac SGT clock.

notes: Uses OBSBOT hardware MJPEG through GStreamer and discards four warm-up frames. The first cold-open run took 2.028 s and failed; the immediate acceptance rerun passed. Frame copied to Mac as artifacts/m1-camera.jpg (SHA-256 bc6a3c9ceaf292c113394a1c72e49a993bf3bc021a2fb545627343d7243ec8e0) and visually confirmed as the workspace view.
